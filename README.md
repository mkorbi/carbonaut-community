# Carbonaut Community

## Welcome to the Carbonaut community!

We are currently in the process of setting up the open source project. Watch this repository to track changes with updates on the community.

## Roadmap

The project roadmap is available [here](https://github.com/orgs/carbonaut/projects/1).
New initiatives for the roadmap will be marked as `roadmap-proposal` by a maintainer. A community decision will then be made as documented in [Decision Making](./governance-charter.md#decision-making).

## Contributing

All contributors are welcome!
Please see the contributing guidelines
[here](https://github.com/carbonaut/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Contributing prerequisites (CLA/DCO)

At the moment the project does not define a
Contributor License Agreement or 
[Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/dco).
By submitting pull requests submitters acknowledge they grant the [Apache License v2](./LICENSE) to the code and that they are eligible to grant this license for all commits submitted in their pull requests.

## Governance

We will establish a governance following the CNCF recommended practices. Until then, a temporary governance charter can be found [here](./governance-charter.md).

## Code of Conduct

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

The project and its community abide by [the Code of Conduct](https://github.com/carbonaut/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org),
version 2.1, available
[here](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html).

## Carbonaut Automation

A few bots are in use to automate various things for the carbonaut project.
* **policy-bot**: Define approval and disapproval policies that needs to be met before merging pull requests. For example if the label `hold/do-not-merge` is set the PR is not approved.
* **merge-bot**: Automatically merge pull requests as soon as approval requirements passed.
* **governance-bot**: The bot is used to enable _slash commands_ and generally streamline the workflow (commands can be found in the [governance.yml](https://github.com/carbonaut-cloud/community/blob/main/.github/governance.yml)).
